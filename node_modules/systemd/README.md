# systemd for Node.js

  Adds support for running node.js as a socket-activated service under systemd.

  More info on the how and why: https://rocketeer.be/articles/deploying-node-js-with-systemd/

  For more background on socket activation: http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activation.html

  Obviously, this will only work on Linux distributions with systemd (such as Fedora).

## Usage

  You can install the latest version via npm:

```sh
$ npm install systemd
```

  Require the systemd module and pass 'systemd' as a parameter to listen():

```javascript
require('systemd');

var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen('systemd');
```

  Install a systemd socket file (e.g.: /etc/systemd/system/node-hello.socket):

```ini
[Socket]
ListenStream=1337

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
```

  Install a systemd service file (e.g.: /etc/systemd/system/node-hello.service):

```ini
# Adjust according to man 5 systemd.exec

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/bin/node /path/to/hello.js
StandardOutput=syslog
User=nobody
Group=nobody
```

  Be sure to substitute the paths to node and your script!

  * &#x26A0; __Run node directly__ or make sure your startup helper scripts
    can hand over the sockets. `npm start` [probably won't work][issue-11].

  [issue-11]: https://github.com/rubenv/node-systemd/issues/11

  Reload the systemd daemon so that it picks up the new unit files:

```sh
$ systemctl --system daemon-reload
```

  Enable and start the socket:

```sh
$ systemctl enable node-hello.socket
$ systemctl start node-hello.socket
```

  Check the status of the socket:

```sh
$ systemctl status node-hello.socket
node-hello.socket
      Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/node-hello.socket)
      Active: active (listening) since Sat, 15 Oct 2011 20:27:47 +0200; 2s ago
      CGroup: name=systemd:/system/node-hello.socket
```

  Great, it's running!

  Check the status of the service, not running yet:

```sh
$ systemctl status node-hello.service
node-hello.service
      Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/node-hello.service)
      Active: inactive (dead)
      CGroup: name=systemd:/system/node-hello.service
```

  Do a request to your service:

```sh
$ curl -i http://localhost:1337/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Connection: keep-alive
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Hello World
```

  Check again, now it will be running:

```sh
$ systemctl status node-hello.service
node-hello.service
      Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/node-hello.service)
      Active: active (running) since Sat, 15 Oct 2011 20:32:10 +0200; 38s ago
    Main PID: 1159 (node)
      CGroup: name=systemd:/system/node-hello.service
              â”” 1159 /path/to/bin/node /path/to/hello.js
```

## Only listen to systemd when running under systemd

  You can make the systemd usage conditional by checking for the systemd environment variable:

```javascript
var http = require('http');

require('systemd');

var port = process.env.LISTEN_PID > 0 ? 'systemd' : 1337;
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(port);
```

  This makes it possible to run the script stand-alone in development, yet use systemd when started through systemd.

  A jshint file is included to check code style.

  Before submitting a pull request, please check your code. For convenience, I've also added a grunt file.

  Install the dev dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install --dev
```

  Install the grunt cli if you haven't already done so:

```sh
$ npm -g install grunt-cli
```

  Run it:

```sh
$ grunt
```
